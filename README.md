### Why you need a README

The `README.md` is the landing page for your project. It helps people understand, at a glance, whether your project is something that will be useful to them.

`README` files typically include information on:

- What the project does
- The features and benefits of the project
- How users can get started with the project
- Where users can get help with your project
- Who maintains and contributes to the project
