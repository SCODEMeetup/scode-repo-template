Issues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs.
Issue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance.
They make collaboration easier by:

- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place
- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>
- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions
- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions
